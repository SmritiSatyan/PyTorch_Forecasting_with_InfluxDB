# PyTorch_Forecasting_with_InfluxDB

# Introduction

[InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/) is a database that specializes in the collection, storage, and processing of time series data.
In this Python project, you will see:
1. How to establish [connection](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb-client-python/blob/master/examples/influx_cloud.py) between InfluxDB and InfluxDB client,
2. How to push data to InfluxDB using [a dataframe](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb-client-python/blob/master/examples/ingest_large_dataframe.py),
3. How to [fetch dataframe from InfluxDB](https://github.com/SmritiSatyan/PyTorch_Forecasting_with_InfluxDB/blob/main/ingest_and_query.py) to Python client, and
4. How to use this data to perform [forecasting](https://github.com/jdb78/pytorch-forecasting/blob/master/docs/source/tutorials/stallion.ipynb) using PyTorch.


First, we install ``influxdb`` and ``influxdb-client`` that will help establish connection between InfluxDB Cloud and Python client. We use [PyTorch](https://pytorch-forecasting.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) forecasting to make predctions on this data. For this, we install ``torch`` and ``pytorch-forecasting``. We use the Stallion time series data present in PyTorch. We predict the beverage sales (in dollars) for 6 months based on 21,000 rows of historical data.  

Stallion data contains the below datasets:
* pricesalespromotion.csv: Holds the price, sales & promotion in dollars.
* historicalvolume.csv: contains sales data.
* weather.csv: the average maximum temperature at Agency monthly
* Industrysodasales.csv: Holds industry level soda sales 
* eventcalendar.csv: Holds event details (sports, carnivals, etc.)
* industry_volume.csv: industry actual beer volume
* demographics.csv: demographic details
